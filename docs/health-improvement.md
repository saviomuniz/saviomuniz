# My health improvement during the pandemic crisis

*A non-coaching story for people who are looking for a few tips*

## A little disclaimer first¬†‚ö†Ô∏è

I want to start by making a disclaimer that I'm a software engineer, which means I'm far from the best person to give any nutritionist/psychological advices, which means this is merely a personal report of how I managed to improve my life quality, with great help from medical professionals and my experience of remote working for the last years.

## Don't make my entire home my office¬†üè°  
  
When working remotely, the most important deal for me is to not make my entire home my office. This will very quickly break my emotional, because I always feel like my work is never done and I most certainly will, once, twice, or maybe every day, not respect my work time.
Now I know that not all people have a whole room at their disposal to make it their office, but for me a simple desk that I can do all my work on can be what I call my office.

## Waking up early¬†‚è∞  
  
I could wake up at 10am and start working right away, but I'm a father of a 5 year old kid and that by definition makes it impossible to wake up so late. Not only that, but I realized sleeping that much killed the whole personal side of my life.  

I decided then to wake up everyday at 6am. I start my day by working out, then I take a shower and go straightly to the kitchen. I do the dishes, cook my son his breakfast and then join him for his virtual classes. Later on, I cook the lunch and lastly get breakfast ready for me and my wife.  

The best part about waking up so early is that I don't have to rush to do any of those things, I do them with passion and enjoying both good talks with my son and wife during breakfast and watching my favorite youtube channels while cooking the meals.

## Work out¬†üèãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I had been a sedentary person for the last 6 years, this made me gain incredible 30 kgs. This was mostly because my life was one big rush between working and trying to get my bachelor's and being a father. By the end of the last year I decided that was about to change, and what helped me the most to change the way I saw exercising was thinking:

> This is not supposed to be fun, it's supposed to get my health better, just like any medicine does

Within a few months I could see how much going through regular exercises made me feel good:

- I could breath better;
- I lost a ton of weight (30kgs total, almost 20 of them during the quarantine);
- I felt a lot more energetic;
- I slept a lot better (even stop snoring)

During the quarantine I felt really depressed because I couldn't go to the gym anymore, I reinvented that by running at my apartment's building yard. The gym I used to work out also uploaded great content on YouTube.

## Eat well¬†üçâ  

It took a long while and a great nutritionist to realize that it was possible to eat just fine while losing weight. For me it's all about making the best out of what the nutritionist asks you to consume.  

It's also a big deal for me to have quick preparation meals, I love eating fresh cooked food, but I still don't want to lose the whole day at the kitchen. That being said, I always have my no-sugar coffee at my breakfast, a yogurt and fruits for snacks, a satisfying lunch and a good dinner.

Some examples for delicious and quick meals I get ready for lunch and dinner are:  

### Pea, potato pancakes and cauliflower
- The peas I just cook with a little bit of salt;
- The potato pancakes I make by cooking them, mashing, then seasoning them a bit (oregano, garlic, salt, pepper, rosemary). Then I put the mashed potato on a frying pan and put a big of grated cheese on top;
- I chop the cauliflower with a bit of garlic, season it with salt, pepper and curry. I then add some water so it cook a bit, and lastly I add a tomato sauce.

### Nested spaghetti
- I start by cooking the nested brown spaghetti, I don't let it cook that much because I want to keep the nice nest shape and it'll go back to the oven later on;
- I create a tomato sauce bed for the nests;
- I stuff it with broccoli and leek slices and, once again, season it with garlic, salt, pepper and a tiny bit of paprika;
- I put more tomato sauce on top so it finishes cooking the spaghetti;
- I end it by putting a slice of white cheese on top.

## Find new hobbies, enjoy the old ones¬†üèñ  

Mental health is as important as physical and during the quarantine it's very easy to get anxious for not being able to do stuff I love to do outside of my home. During this time, then, I had to try some new stuff and it felt great. Here are a few new things I've been keeping myself busy with:  
- **Home gardening:** I had tried this a lot before, but it was solely by intuition. I decided to study it a little bit more and give it once again a try. Now my apartment is full of beautiful lovely plants and I just love seeing and taking care of them;
- **Home remodeling:** This was specially important for me, not only because it kept my mind and body busy, but because I'm spending my whole time at home, so I have to guarantee it's the best place I can be;
- **Videogames:** This is not new, it's been there for as long as I can remember. But during the quarantine I could try out new games, finish some of them and it's been an awesome family time for me, my wife and kid;
- **Puzzle assembling:** I bought two puzzles and it's an awesome quiet moment for me and my wife, we've already finished one of them and it felt so good to sit together and assemble while talking and drinking a nice beer/wine.

## Organize my calendar, align expectations üóì
I can't stress enough how important is not overworking for me, it's essential in all possible aspects:
- physical and mental health;
- parenting presence;
- relationship health.

In order to be able to work exactly the time I need as well as not feel frustrated in the end of the day about what I did, I try to always start my work day by saving a few minutes to organize my calendar, saving time slot for meetings and to work on my tasks. I also lock meeting schedule during non-work hours (I have, for instance, both a family time slot and a lunch slot).
One small tip about organizing the calendar is to try to keep meetings tied together, so it's possible to have bigger focus/productive time slots.

Finally, I'd point out how importance for my wellbeing was all of this, I finally realized that keeping healthy and taking care of myself is the first step to actually pursue happiness.
If you feel anxious, depressed, sad or physically bad, I hope I could give you some tips, but the greatest tip in the end is find help, don't just go around reading articles, though it might find you some good tips, it won't give you total guidance for the best wellbeing.
